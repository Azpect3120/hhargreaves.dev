						My name is Hayden Hargreaves, and I am a software engineering student at <span
							class="text-blue-300"
						>
							Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.</span
						>
						I am also pursing a minor in Cyber Security. I am a freshmen who intends to graduate in Spring,
						2028. I have a love for building things and seeing my ideas come to life.
						<br />
						<br />
						In my free time, when I am not coding, I like to workout, I play airsoft, I love mountain
						biking, and I play video games when I need to relax. I have been playing airsoft for nearly
						two years and have loved it from day one! I own countless airsoft guns which include an
						<span class="text-blue-300">Elite Force H&amp;K 416 A5</span>, an
						<span class="text-blue-300"> Elite Force 1911 TAC</span>,
						<span class="text-blue-300">JAG Arms Scattergun Super CQB</span>, and many more.
						<br />
						<br />
						Back at home, I have a dog named <span class="text-blue-300">Penny</span> who is a mini golden-doodle.
						She was named after the character Penny from the show "The Big Bang Theory". She is a very
						energetic dog who loves to play and run around. She will be five years old this July!
